# Computing with Integrity

[paper](paper.pdf)

## Abstract

Computing has always been subjected to shortfalls in the areas of architectural cross-compatibility and information centralization. We define a new, blockchain-based computing platform that standardizes user authentication and file sharing while providing verifiable integrity for application behavior and network services. Filesystems can be created, updated and shared with specific people or the entire world on a per-folder or per-file basis. Application developers can use existing technologies to build never-before-possible solutions for problems that have long plagued the existing model. Open-ended and extensible protocols and APIs provide for future expansion.
