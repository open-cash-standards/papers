# Project Sigma

## Abstract

â€‹We propose a new protocol for cellular communication based on peer-to-peer communication and micropayments. Onion routing provides privacy for transmissions, while GPS coordinates dictate the control frequency used for establishing connections with nearby devices. Nodes and participants can earn money by forwarding data between users, while a scanning method is used to eliminate congestion across the frequency spectrum.
